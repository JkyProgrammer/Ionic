<p>A <b>logic bomb</b> is a piece of <a href="/wiki/Source_code" title="Source code">code</a> intentionally inserted into a <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting <a href="/wiki/Computer_file" title="Computer file">files</a> (such as a <a href="/wiki/Salary" title="Salary">salary</a> <a href="/wiki/Database_trigger" title="Database trigger">database trigger</a>), should they ever be terminated from the company.
</p><p>Software that is inherently malicious, such as <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">viruses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computer_worm" title="Computer worm">worms</a>, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain <a href="/wiki/Payload_(software)" class="mw-redirect" title="Payload (software)">payload</a> at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as <a href="/wiki/Friday_the_13th" title="Friday the 13th">Friday the 13th</a> or <a href="/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" title="April Fools&#39; Day">April Fools' Day</a>. <a href="/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)" title="Trojan horse (computing)">Trojans</a> that activate on certain dates are often called "<a href="/wiki/Time_bomb_(software)" title="Time bomb (software)">time bombs</a>".
</p><p>To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.
